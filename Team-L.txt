# Project Overview

In this project we will develop everything from scratch and we won't be using any existing repositories.

Project Description:
CineBook is a web application designed to facilitate the booking of movie tickets. It provides a user-friendly interface for users to browse available movies, view movie details, book tickets, make payments, and log out. Additionally, it offers administrative functionality for managing movies, including loading movie data into the database, maintaining movie details such as release date and synopsis, and scheduling movie play dates and timings.
