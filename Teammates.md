Project Proposal:	
	
Project Name:  JSON Schema to HTML form generator	

GitHub URL:  https://github.com/brutusin/json-forms	

Description:  It is to support dynamic sub-schemas. Extensible and customizable library with zero dependencies. We currently have no definite plans, but we simply want to ensure that we have priority access to this repository.

[Please describe the changes you propose to make to the linked project. For example, you might implement drag and drop so the user may rearrange elements of the generated form and save the result.]
