Project Proposal: 
    Project Name: LibJS Temporal Implementation Updates for Serenity OS
    GitHub URL: https://github.com/SerenityOS/serenity
    Description: Serenity OS is an operating system implemented from the ground up without external libraries. In this operating system, the team has implemented Javascript in library called LibJS. As a part of their LibJS Javascript implementation, they are implementing the "Temporal" Proposal for the Javascript language. The current implementation of the proposal is a little over 80+ commits behind the current spec proposed by TC-39. We would like to help advance their implementation to be closer to the current spec.
