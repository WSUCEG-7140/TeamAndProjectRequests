Project Title: Restaurant Management System

Project Description:
The Restaurant Management System is a Python-based application designed to streamline and automate various operations in a restaurant. This project utilizes object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts to create classes and objects that represent different entities within the restaurant, such as menus, orders, and customers.

The system allows customers to view the menu, place orders, and track the status of their orders. The menus are stored as objects, with attributes such as dish name, description, and price. Customers can select items from the menu and add them to their order, which is represented by an order object. The system calculates the total bill based on the selected items.

The project employs OOP concepts like encapsulation, where the properties and methods of each class are encapsulated within that class, ensuring data integrity and modularity. Inheritance can be implemented to create specialized classes for different types of menus or customers, inheriting common attributes and behaviors from a base class.
